# About
`Steam Checker 2023` - project I wrote as my first job. It was originally intended for personal use, but to make it easier for others and to generally save work, I decided to move it to GitHub.
I haven't worked on it much, so the checker is pretty easy to run and use.

# Features
- Proxy support: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `SOCKS4`, `SOCKS5`
- Integrated parser
- User-friendly interface

# Known problems
- Unable to bypass `captcha`
- Partial proxy issues
- Slow working speed due to limited server-side requests

# Lastly
Since this work was created by a person with very little experience in development, many errors and inaccuracies may be unknown to me. If you want to point out bugs, I will always listen to you!

`P.S` *Since 04/01/2023, this project is no longer supported.*
